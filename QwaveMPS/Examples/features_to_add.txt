Add spectral intensity and time dependent spectrum functions...

Features to add on future versions:
    Time dependent operator expectation values (to be implemented)
    Coherent pulse (done, just needs copying)
    Time restricted correlation calculations (pass parameters for tmin/tmax to calculate only a subspace)
        Would also want to generalize the helper function that transforms to (t1,t2) domain to be able to work with
        non-square spaces
    Generalized nonmarkovian time evolution (done, just needs copying and adaption to current args)
        Could also include the efficient chiral time evolution at this point maybe
        ...eventually efficient symmetric time evolution when implemented (will require uniform tau)
    Addition of general basis vector / transition operators?
    Move gammas out of input_params (Hamiltonian independent class, params that are true for every system)
