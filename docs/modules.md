# Modules

These are the main modules and scripts in this repository:

- `parameters.py`: This module contains the InputParams and Bins classes used throughout the library
- `hamiltonians.py`: This module contains the Hamiltonians for different cases
- `operators.py`: This module contains the main quantum operators, including the basic boson and TLS operators used to build the Hamiltonian, and observable operators. It also contains single time expectation functions. 
- `simulation.py`: This module contains the functions to evolve the system, both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes.
- `states.py`: This module contains initial states for the waveguide and the TLSs.
- `correlation.py`: This module contains functions to calculate two time correlation functions of the output field.
