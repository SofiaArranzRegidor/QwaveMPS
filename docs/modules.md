# Modules

## Overview

Describe the main modules and scripts in this repository.

- `hamiltonians.py`: This module contains the Hamiltonians for different cases
- `operators.py`: This module contains the main quantum operators, including the basic boson and TLS operators used to build the Hamiltonian, the time evolution operator, swap operator, and expectation and observable operators. 
- `simulation.py`: This module contains the functions to apply SVDs, evolve the system both in the Markovian and non-Markovian regimes, and functions to calculate the main observables.
- `states.py`: This module contains initial states for the waveguide and the TLSs.
